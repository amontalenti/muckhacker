# MuckHacker Python project (mucklib)

Python module that implements the muckhacker library, including routines for:

* a simple accounts system
* authentication using 3rd-party services and/or two-factor
* encrypting and publishing information, both source materials and post drafts
* managing post drafts (once decrypted) for collaboration and editing
* a simple CMS API for displaying public information online
* a pod-to-pod communication protocol for making a "hive mind" of muck.cc nodes
* an example renderer using the CMS API


webcore
-------
webcore is a small web service that does three things:
* exposes the muckhacker api
* hosts the inline post-editor
* hosts the admin site

####setup
(from project root)

     fab provision:host=[somemachine-somewhere]

(on the box you just configured)

     cd ~/muckhacker/mucklib/webcore
     python models.py
     python app.py # Dev server is now running!
